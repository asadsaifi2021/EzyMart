              <h3>Audience</h3>
              <p>
                EzyMart is designed to serve the users as buyers within its
                local community through a dedicated delivery service. Users
                outside the delivery area can browse and explore product
                listings for informational purposes or personal planning.
              </p>

              <h3>Values</h3>
              <p>
                The use of such digital shopping, like EzyMart, is always a
                critical improvement in a society where there are groups of
                people with traveling disabilities who struggle to go to
                supermarkets to buy daily goods. Not just a solution to such
                critical problems, it is also a convenient tool for anyone
                wanting to reduce the time and effort spent on grocery shopping.
                Such features include a search bar and an account-based system
                that secures and personalizes customers' accounts to promote a
                positive and engaging user experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond just convenience, EzyMart prioritizes sustainability and
                community impact. By providing the item information online and
                an optimized delivery service model, the app helps lower carbon
                emissions associated with individual travel. Furthermore,
                EzyMart provides an outlet for local farmers to consumers,
                simplifying the partnership model by eliminating the friction of
                logistical hurdles like having a storefront vs. in-house
                inventory management.
              </p>

              <h3>Success Measures</h3>
              <p>
                The project is considered to be successful if all the features
                are implemented and cover all the requirements of a customer in
                a shopping session. Time execution from users will also be
                accounted for. Customers should spend 50% less time, compared to
                shopping in person, creating their final cart.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project is considered to be successful if the customers’
                overall experience and effectiveness are drastically improved
                compared to the real-life experience of shopping in the
                supermarket. In particular, we will mainly account for the
                execution time from the user to create their final cart and make
                an order in EzyMart. We will collect the relevant data from the
                team members’ friends and family members, who have no computer
                science background and are unfamiliar with EzyMart. We expect
                the number of testers to be around 15 and the average amount of
                time is 50% less compared to average time shopping in person.

              <p>
                <strong>Layer 2 - Business Layer (business package):</strong>
                Includes handler classes that implement business logic and
                rules, acting as a bridge between the presentation and
                persistence layers.

              <p>
                <strong>Service Locator Pattern:</strong> A key architectural
                feature is the Service Locator Pattern implemented through the
                <code>Services</code> class. It acts as a centralized registry
                for accessing persistence layer implementations. This pattern
                offers a form of dependency injection that decouples the
                business layer from specific persistence implementations.

              <h4>Did any features work better than expected?</h4>

              <p>
                <strong>Features That Exceeded Expectations:</strong> Several
                features turned out to be more robust, seamless, or
                user-friendly than initially anticipated.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Database Fault Tolerance:</strong> Our system
                demonstrated sophisticated error recovery by automatically
                detecting failures, falling back to alternate persistence
                methods, and self-healing without requiring any user
                intervention. This significantly improved the reliability of the
                app.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Offline Functionality:</strong> We were surprised by how
                smoothly the app performed offline. Non-authenticated users
                could browse and manage their cart even without an internet
                connection, resulting in a more resilient and accessible
                shopping experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Session Management:</strong> The transition between
                guest and authenticated user states worked flawlessly. The
                automatic cart transfer on login ensured that users never lost
                their progress, enhancing overall usability.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Search System:</strong> Our search feature evolved
                across multiple iterations and became a powerful tool for
                product discovery. Its filtering capabilities were intuitive and
                exceeded our original expectations in terms of both performance
                and user experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Nutrition Information:</strong> We used the decorator
                pattern to elegantly layer nutritional details onto products.
                This enhanced the user experience without disrupting the core
                system architecture, proving both clean and extensible in
                design.

              <h4>
                What did you learn about team or large project development? What
                will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?
              </h4>

              <p>
                One of the most unexpected and valuable lessons we learned as a
                group during this course was that
                <strong>your program can always have errors</strong>, no matter
                how simple it seems. At the beginning of the term, we
                intentionally designed a relatively small and straightforward
                application, avoiding complex or novel features. Our goal was to
                ensure we could deliver all promised functionalities reliably.
                However, we soon realized that even simple features can become
                complicated when integrated across all three architecture
                layers—business, logic, and data.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Start doing:</strong> We will allocate more time for
                feature integration and thorough testing at each layer. We’ll
                also perform incremental testing more frequently, rather than
                assuming that a working stub means the feature is "done." This
                will help us identify issues earlier in the development process
                and improve the stability of our codebase.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Keep doing:</strong> We’ll continue our practice of
                early planning and scoping down features to keep the project
                manageable. This approach helped us stay organized and focused,
                even when unexpected bugs or setbacks occurred. Clear project
                boundaries also made it easier to assign tasks and track
                progress as a team.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Stop doing:</strong> We will stop assuming that a
                feature is complete just because it works in isolation. Instead,
                we’ll treat integration and full-stack behavior as a critical
                part of the development cycle. A feature must function correctly
                within the broader system context before we consider it
                finished.
              </p>

              <p>
                Overall, this project taught us to expect the unexpected in
                team-based software development. It reinforced the importance of
                collaboration, testing, and flexibility. Most importantly, we
                learned to always leave room for debugging—no matter how
                confident we feel about a piece of code.

              <h4>
                Are there any particular design smells, or brilliant design
                decisions?
              </h4>

              <p>
                <strong>Design Smells:</strong> While our architecture had
                strengths, several design issues were identified during
                development.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Service Locator Complexity:</strong> The
                <code>Services</code> class violates the Single Responsibility
                Principle by handling multiple concerns such as connection
                management, persistence creation, and error handling. This made
                it harder to test and maintain.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Dependency Inversion Issues:</strong> The business layer
                directly depends on the <code>Services</code> class rather than
                using proper dependency injection, resulting in tighter coupling
                and reduced flexibility.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Inconsistent Error Handling:</strong> We observed a mix
                of null returns, boolean indicators, and exceptions across the
                codebase, which led to inconsistent behavior and made debugging
                more challenging.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Inheritance Over Composition:</strong> Some classes
                relied on inheritance where composition would have provided
                better modularity and more maintainable code.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Brilliant Design Decisions:</strong> Despite the above,
                the project featured a number of thoughtful architectural
                choices that greatly benefited development.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Three-Tier Architecture:</strong> We maintained a clear
                separation between presentation, business logic, and data access
                layers, which helped keep the codebase organized and scalable.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Multiple Persistence Implementations:</strong> Our
                system supported HSQLDB, stubs, and SharedPreferences with
                runtime switching, making the application flexible and easy to
                test in different environments.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Robust Fault Tolerance:</strong> We implemented
                sophisticated error recovery and automatic fallback mechanisms,
                improving reliability and user experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Extension Mechanism:</strong> Clean extension points
                allowed us to add new features without modifying the core
                architecture, which is a hallmark of good design.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Session Management:</strong> The transition between
                guest and authenticated user states was seamless, ensuring
                smooth user experience across different app states.

                became more polished, the GitLab repository was better
                structured, and our commit messages and comments improved
                overall code clarity.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Impact on Technical Progress:</strong> While shifting
                some developers and testers to focus on documentation improved
                organization, it came at a cost. This reallocation of resources
                slowed technical progress, ultimately leading to the removal of
                the Coupons feature.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Challenges in Communication:</strong> Initially, our
                team had strong communication and motivation. However, under
                pressure, check-ins became less frequent, leading to some
                confusion in task coordination and decision-making.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Final Outcomes:</strong> Despite these challenges, we
                successfully delivered 11 out of 12 planned features with full
                testing. However, we identified some violations of SOLID
                principles, particularly the Single Responsibility Principle
                (SRP) and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), highlighting the
                need for more frequent mid-iteration code reviews.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Key Takeaways:</strong> The iteration reinforced our
                ability to adapt and work as a team, but balancing priorities
                between development, documentation, and communication remains an
                area for growth in future projects.
